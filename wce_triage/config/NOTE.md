# Config

config directory is for configuraing the server machine, not any client.
"setup" is for setting up (bootstrapping) machines. This is for managing the configuration of server.
(Or any machine I guess)

I think the all of config settings should be in single file. I could use sqlite3 or JSON or both.

It's in DB, and can be exported and imported.
This should include the updates.

## Network config

## pxeboot config
