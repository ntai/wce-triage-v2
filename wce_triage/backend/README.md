# backend

**OBSOLETE**

This is a reimplementation of the http server. HTTP server is a aiohttp server and 
there is little to no braincell used to implement it.

I decided to use Flask for V2 of triage backend, and it is now nearly complete.
Yet, I am thinking to re-do with FastAPI. Look code in ../api
