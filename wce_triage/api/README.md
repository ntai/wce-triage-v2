# api

This is a re-reimplementation of the http server. HTTP server is a aiohttp server and 
there is little to no braincell used to implement it.

The Flask implementation somewhat works but I find it unsustainable. 

The lack of structure of Flask is easy to get going but when the service is 
REST based, Flask falls (at least for me). 

So, I moved all of code from ../backend and implemented.
